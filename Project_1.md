## Project 1

### Geometric Bar Plot of Gabon

Produced a combined spatial description and geometric bar plot of Gabon's population. One modification I needed to make was importing the `scales` library instead of `units` for the percent() command. From the population and density map, we can see that the province of Estuaire is by far the most populous, and part of this could be due to the geography. Gabon's western border is the Atlantic Ocean, which probably means there are trading ports that bring rises in population with them.
