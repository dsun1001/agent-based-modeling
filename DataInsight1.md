### GeoSimMR: A MapReduce Algorithm for Detecting Communities based on Distance and Interest in Social Networks

Social network sites such as Facebook play a large role in our lives due to their ability to link users together. With the rise in popularity of social media, there is a need for new techniques to process their data. Each social network can be represented by a graph, in which users are nodes and the relations between individual users are the edges. Each node can also have a list of attributes to define user interests. The research done by Al Aghbari, Bahutair, and Kamel identifies a new algorithm for detecting communities in a given social network based on geodesic locations of nodes and the similarities in their interests (GeoSim Algorithm). 

Social networks can be represented as graphs with nodes and edges. The nodes represent real-wrold users in a social network, and the edges represent friendship relations between the users. GeoSim clusters the given graph into communities based on how related each node is. Node similarity is based on how close the two nodes are in their connections and also their interests. A group of nodes that are very related to each other is classified as a community. 

The problem at hand is how to define a metric to measure the relatedness between two nodes for making clusters in the network. Any two users that are connected to each other should not necessarily belong to the same community, for example if their interests are completely opposite of each other. Conversely, users with identical interests should not always be in the same community either if they have no relation to each other. 

The GeoSim algorithm works by incorporating both the nodes interests and the distances from each other in order to cluster nodes together. The geodesic distance is calculated by using Dijkstra's algorithm in order to find the shortest path between two nodes. In order to determine the similarity between interests, the WordNet ontology is used to find the information content of each word, and a calculation is made to determine how similar two interests are. The GeoSim algorithm takes all the nodes in a social network and their friends and interests, as well as the number of communities that the graph should be divided into. It returns the set of detected communities. 

The researchers also created a parallel version of the algorithm, GeoSimMR, which helps run the algorithm in parallel when working with large social networks. The GeoSim algorithm was able to identify communities with high accuracy and group close nodes with similar interests. Community detection is important because of the impact it has on applications such as recommendations, influence analysis, and also customer segmentation.
