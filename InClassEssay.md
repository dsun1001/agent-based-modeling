  Agent based modeling (ABM) has become a powerful tool for simulating real world problems. The potential for using ABM as a mathematical model to evaluate situations before they happen helps to make informed decisions. Traditionally, ABM modeled complex systems through using agents with behavior described with simple rules, but the rise in volume and specificity of data has grown significantly which has allowed for ABM to model individuals with distinct characteristics, which results in more accurate results. This differs from other traditional mathematical models which assume a homogenous population. As we've seen in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, having the ability to predict health outcomes and inform public policy decisions to ultimately save lives is where I hope ABM can help us to better understand human behavior at the community scale.
