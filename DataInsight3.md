### An Automated Machine Learning Based Decision Support System to Predict Hotel Booking Cancellations

Revenue management, which is the "application of information systems and pricing strategies to allocate the right capacity to the right customer at the right price at the right time" is used in a wide array of service industries, including hotels. Hotels accept bookings in advance, and these bookings give customers the right to use the service in the future at an agreed price. The customer also has the right to cancel their booking, which poses a risk to the hotel. The hotels need to guarantee that they have enough rooms for all customers with bookings, but also bear the cost of having vacant rooms. Cancellations can represent 20% of a hotel's total bookings, and this increases to 60% in the case of airport and roadside hotels. In order to combat losing revenue from cancellations, hotels overbook and have restrictive cancellation policies. Both of these strategies have their own flaws. Overbooking can lead to damaging hotel reputation and revenue if they need to deny service to customers. Restrictive cancellation policies can hurt the number of bookings in the first place. 

The researchers of this paper designed a system to provide a way to model customer cancellations. The system was designed around several different goals: to automate modeling tasks, to deliver the data to inform hotel decisions, and to register the information to measure model success in a real environment. A CRISP-DM methodology was used to build the machine learning models. Production environment models showed a tendency for the models to overfit, and perform poorly when given unknown bookings that had a date in the future not included in the model development process. Researchers also used a gradient tree boosting algorithm, XGBoost, to build the classification models to predict the booking's cancellation outcome. This model was used because it is effective and fast, as well as being able to control the amount of overfitting. 

The system built also continuously learned with the daily incorporation of new bookings, with both changes to existing bookings and also the outcomes of previous predictions. This allowed the system to build new models with the daily data in order to produce better results. The results of the study shows that Analytics-as-a-Service support systems can be built and deployed. It helps explore new indicators for assessment of performance. The researchers developed a new metric for evaluating performance of binary classification when observation characteristics are either unstable or when the outcome of the prediction is affected by time. Another important contribution that the study had was the development of a weighting system that allowed for the model to train and learn from both more recent observations and also from the real outcomes of previous predictions. The prototypes developed by the researchers were put into real-world conditions, and helped assess the performance of the systems. This study was able to demonstrate the real benefits of machine learning in business information systems. 

The study had final results with accuracy greater than 0.84, precision greater than 0.82, and area under curve greater than 0.88, which shows that they were able to predict cancellation outcomes relatively well. The ability of the model to predict customers enabled hotels to take action for preventing cancellation at a limited cost. Preventing cancellations saved revenue of about $45,000.
