### Automatic Data Standardization for the Global Cryosphere Watch Data Portal
The Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) was initiated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to support Earth System monitoring, modelling, and prediction services focused on the cryosphere. The cryosphere is an important component of the Earth system which includes snow, ice, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground. The cryosphere is a global phenomenon that occurs at all lattitudes, is critical for the water supply, and has a large influence over the global climate. It is sensitive to climate change, and is one of the key peices of evidence for our changing climate. It is critical to monitor, but consists of some of the most remote regions of the earth, which leads to undersampling. A large amount of the data available also comes from the scientific community, and therefore is not readily usable by national meteorological and hydrological services. 

The GCW address the gap in this data by supporting key cryospheric in-situ and remote sensing observations. The GCW distributes data to WMO and the broader scientific community to help with sustained monitoring of the cryosphere. It helps to standardize best practices for measuring snow and ice, creating a glossary of cryospheric terms, and helps with data exchange by building the CryoNet network of surface stations and providing a data portal. 

For the data portal, the contributors are generally small groups that oversee the entire data collection process. They set up the stations and maintain them. A survey found that while there were some resources available to manage the stations' data, these resources were not sufficient to set up complex data sharing schemes. More specifically, the data did not match WMO standards, and so the data is not able to integrate into WMO dataflows. Additionally, data does not come in a standard format, and accompanying metadata was often in the originating country's language. 

Data users range from single users to large organizations, and their use cases range from simple statistical analysis to full weather forecast systems. Getting the data and preparing it for use is a highly time consuming task, and another survey found that often there was need for direct contact with the data producers in order to request missing data as well as clarify the contents of the data. Data also came in a variety of formats, and so this leads to a high cost to integrate new data sources. 

The data portal created offers data producers toolchains that are compliant with existing standards, and have easy to use validators. These standards are heavily promoted to large and well known data producers in order to make sure that data users can encounter familiar formats during their work. Data converters also help both data producers and data users to transition to following the same standards. Once data users have become accustomed to reading data in a standard format, then they are able to easily access a large pool of data and later can request smaller data producers to transition to using the same standards. The toolchain produced is also highly automated and requires little manual care, which shows that producing standard compliant data is able to be done in a cost effective manner.
