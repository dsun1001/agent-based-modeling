## Projecting, Plotting, and Labelling Administrative Subdivisions of Liberia

Produced a plot of Liberia with it's first and second level of administrative subdivisions. I also produced the same plot, but of Angola.

### Individual Stretch Goal 1: 

For this part, I followed the same steps as above but took shp files from HDX. From looking it over, it would appear the HDX and GADM data are the same/similar, and upon further investigation [from this link](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/angola-administrative-levels-0-3) in the metadata tab it says that GADM is the source.
